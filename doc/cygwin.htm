<H2> Introduction </H2>

<P> Most contemporary operating systems trace their underlying design
to the Unix operating system,
as refined and specified today by the POSIX family of standards.
Microsoft Windows, however, was developed independently and
defines a different set of interfaces for the programmer and the user.

<P> The <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</A> package provides a
Unix environment under Microsoft Windows.
This allows the latest version of Icon (and many other things)
to be built on a Windows system.
Successful use of Cygwin requires familiarity with both 
Windows and Unix.

<P> This document describes some of the peculiarities of the Cygwin
port of Version 9.4 of Icon.
These differences are not necessarily identified in other documentation.


<H2> Building Icon </H2>

<P> The Cygwin package is available from
<A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">www.cygwin.com</A>.
A custom installation of the Cygwin system is required;
the default installation provides a bare-bones system
insufficient for building software.
Icon requires a C compiler and the usual tools and utilities
available on a standard POSIX development system; these are found
in the <CODE>gcc-core</CODE> and <CODE>make</CODE> packages.
The <CODE>xorg</CODE> family of packages is also needed
to build Icon with graphics enabled.

<P> Icon is built in a Cygwin shell window.
The process is the same as on other platforms
and uses the configuration named <CODE>cygwin</CODE>.
See the <A HREF=build.htm>installation documentation</A>
for instructions on building Icon.


<H2> Running Icon programs </H2>

<P> Icon is run by commands entered in a Cygwin terminal window.
The simplest command is "<CODE>icon prog.icn</CODE>",
which runs the program contained in the source file <CODE>prog.icn</CODE>.
The translator <CODE>icont</CODE> can create executable programs
from Icon source code.
The Unix-style "man pages" for <A HREF=icon.txt><CODE>icon</CODE></A>
and <A HREF=icont.txt><CODE>icont</CODE></A>
describe the command options in a traditionally cryptic manner.


<H2> Interpreter path </H2>

<P> Icon programs require an interpreter for execution.
On Windows, the path of the interpreter is not embedded
in an executable program.
The program must be able to find
<CODE>iconx.exe</CODE> in one of these locations:
<UL>
    <LI> in the file named by the <CODE>ICONX</CODE> environment variable
    <LI> in the same directory as the executable program
    <LI> in the search path
</UL>


<H2> Extra built-in functions </H2>

<P> For compatibility with an earlier port of Icon to Windows,
this implementation includes some extra built-in functions.
The functions are described in section 6.2 of
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/docs/ipd271.htm">IPD271</A>,
which documents that earlier port.

<P> These unsupported functions are not part of Icon on other platforms,
so their use renders a program non-portable.


<H2> Feature test symbols </H2>

<P> The symbols <CODE>_MS_WINDOWS</CODE> and <CODE>_CYGWIN</CODE>
are defined by the Icon preprocessor.
The symbol <CODE>_GRAPHICS</CODE> is defined if Icon is built with
graphics enabled.
The symbols <CODE>_UNIX</CODE> and <CODE>_X_WINDOW_SYSTEM</CODE>
are not defined.
The corresponding strings are produced or omitted, as appropriate,
by the <CODE>&amp;features</CODE> keyword.


<H2> No dynamic loading </H2>

The dynamic loading interface &mdash; <CODE>loadfunc()</CODE> &mdash; 
is not implemented.


<H2> Known bugs </H2>

<UL>
    <LI>Some Unix dependencies cause tests <CODE>io</CODE>, <CODE>tpp</CODE>,
    and <CODE>opts</CODE> to fail.
    <LI> Resizing a window sends a large number of events to the program.
</UL>
