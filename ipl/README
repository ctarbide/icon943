This is Version 9.4.3 of the Icon Program Library.
For on-line documentation, see
	http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v943/library/ipl.htm

Unix users should generally not try to build the library separately, but
instead should install Icon 9.4.3 as a whole, which includes the library.

The MT-Icon portions of the library (the m*) directories are for use with
specially configured versions of Icon, for which no support is provided.
